 * This project is a simple test to make sure that the different functions
 * available in my-nc_flashcard.h are working properly; a predecessor to the
 * flashcard program that I am writing for my son, so that he can be able
 * to practice his multiplication on anything from a text-only terminal to
 * a terminal on any machine in the house.  It seems like so many of the other
 * programs that I've used are buggy...  I figured, why not put this library
 * to use, get more familiar with C again, and code him up something simple
 * and quick that'll get the job done.
